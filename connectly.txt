Overview
Connectly.ai is a conversational commerce company focused on simplifying how SMBs transform customer messages into revenue.  Our tools centralize customer communications - across WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger and Instagram - removing the friction from message-driven sales and enabling businesses to treat their customers like people, not tickets.  

Connectly.ai was founded in 2020 by former Big Tech executives who saw a need for smaller businesses to gain equity in conversational commerce, a market that is expected to become a $130B market by 2025, according to Forrester.

Vision
& Mission
We believe businesses need to adopt a message-first mindset to succeed. Our vision is to create the AI-powered infrastructure of the future to make this as easy as possible; enabling businesses to operate the full flywheel - marketing, sales, transactions, customer experience -all within the customer’s thread of choice.

Founder
Story
Connectly was founded by Stefanos Loukakos (ex-Director, Head of Messenger & Blockchain at Facebook) and Yandong Liu (ex-CTO of Strava and Engineer at Uber) who met through a friend in the founder community. With a shared passion for messaging - between Stefanos’ role at Facebook and Yandong’s role leading a highly successful SMS initiative to onboard Uber drivers - they launched Connectly to help businesses make the most of their customer messages in an increasingly complex ecosystem.
